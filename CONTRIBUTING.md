CONTRIBUTING TO 43f
===================

We welcome feedback, bug fixes, and features improvements. Ultimately, what gets
accepted and merged into the project is up to [Morgan Aldridge](http://github.com/morgant), 
the current project maintainer, but you are encouraged to submit your 
improvements.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------

You will need the following to contribute:

* A [GithHub](http://github.com) account for submitting pull requests
* [`roundup`](http://github.com/bmizerany/roundup) for running test cases

And, optionally, but highly suggested:

* [`bashdb`](http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/) for easier debugging

MAKING CHANGES
--------------

You will need to do the following to make changes that are most likely to be
accepted with little headache and back & forth:

1. Fork the [`43f`](https://github.com/morgant/43f) project on GitHub
2. Create a topic branch from the `master` branch
3. Make commits in logical units and with properly explanatory commit messages
4. Add  tests to validate any functional changes
5. Run all unit tests to confirm that nothing else broke.

SUBMITTING CHANGES
------------------

When you've completed your changes and are ready for them to be merged into the
main project, you can do the following to submit them for review and likely
inclusion in `43f`:

1. Push your changes to your fork of the `43f` project on GitHub
2. Submit a pull request to the [`43f`](https://github.com/morgant/43f) project

That's all there is to it. If you followed the "Making Changes" guidelines and 
the changes are aligned with the vision of the project, it should be a pretty 
smooth process to get them merged in.
